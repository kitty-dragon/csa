### Challenge ~~Spying~~ Surveillance Agency

We aim to provide a consistent back-up storage for all your challenge matches.

Free. Simple to use. No registration required. No opt-out possible.

Did you forget the name of that card you sideboarded in against Elves half a year ago in your 1-4 match that no one cares about? And where exactly your opponent suggested you to shove it up when you swept their entire board with it? No worries, we saved all this data for you.

In the future we may expand this database to include various wrongful actions, including, but not limited to:
 - acts of terrorism (e.g. playing affinity in just for fun room)
 - abuse of power (e.g. casting end of turn Gush)
 - other crimes against humanity (e.g. using 101 card deck with no win conditions)
